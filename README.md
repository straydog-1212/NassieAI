# NassieAI

Welcome to the NassieAI project! Our initiative is dedicated to creating an open-source, real-time interactive AI that operates locally. Our goal is to empower users to configure this AI to perform a wide range of tasks. With this project, anyone with a server can host their own Ollama model, engaging in real-time conversations and receiving audio responses. We're currently focusing on developing a web version of the AI and have plans to extend our platform to the Android operating system in the future. Join us as we shape the future of conversational AI together!

## Project Overview

Once complete NassieAI will have the following key components:

- **Speech Recognition**: Integration of speech recognition functionality to convert spoken audio into text inputs for processing.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Incorporation of AI models to analyze user inputs, generate conversational responses, and provide informative content.
- **Web Deployment**: Development of a web-based interface for interacting with the voice-enabled application via browsers.
- **Android App Deployment**: Creation of a native Android application with features for audio input, communication with the backend server, and displaying AI-generated responses.

## Features

- **Conversational AI**: Engage users in natural language conversations and provide informative responses based on AI-generated content.
- **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: Convert spoken audio inputs into text for processing using speech recognition technology.
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Analyze user inputs and extract relevant information using natural language processing techniques.
- **Real-Time Audio Streaming**: Establish bidirectional audio communication between the client and server using WebRTC for real-time audio streaming.
- **Web Interface**: Develop a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the voice-enabled application via browsers.
- **Android App**: Create a native Android application with features for audio input, communication with the backend server, and displaying AI-generated responses.
