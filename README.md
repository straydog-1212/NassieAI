# Voice-Enabled Application

Welcome to the Voice-Enabled Application project! This project aims to develop a voice-enabled application that integrates speech recognition, artificial intelligence (AI), and WebRTC audio streaming for both web and Android platforms. The application will facilitate natural language conversations with users and provide informative responses based on AI-generated content.

## Project Overview

The Voice-Enabled Application project encompasses the following key components:

- **Speech Recognition**: Integration of speech recognition functionality to convert spoken audio into text inputs for processing.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Incorporation of AI models to analyze user inputs, generate conversational responses, and provide informative content.
- **WebRTC Audio Streaming**: Implementation of WebRTC for real-time bidirectional audio streaming between the client and server.
- **Web Deployment**: Development of a web-based interface for interacting with the voice-enabled application via browsers.
- **Android App Deployment**: Creation of a native Android application with features for audio input, communication with the backend server, and displaying AI-generated responses.

## Features

- **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: Convert spoken audio inputs into text for processing using speech recognition technology.
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Analyze user inputs and extract relevant information using natural language processing techniques.
- **Conversational AI**: Engage users in natural language conversations and provide informative responses based on AI-generated content.
- **Real-Time Audio Streaming**: Establish bidirectional audio communication between the client and server using WebRTC for real-time audio streaming.
- **Web Interface**: Develop a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the voice-enabled application via browsers.
- **Android App**: Create a native Android application with features for audio input, communication with the backend server, and displaying AI-generated responses.
